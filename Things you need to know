This file contains a list of thing you need to know to run the portal.

1.  Setting up the portal for a new year:
    - Update the 'active_report_year' value in the 'system_configuration_variables' database table
    - In the application under Summary admin > Yearly setup > Yearly setup press the three buttons in order
    - These three buttons can also be used to reset tracking of who has submitted information.
    - Note: Whenever the application references a year it uses a function 'get_current_summary_report_year'
      in utilities.py.

2.  Pushing changes to the application:
    - Instructions are in the 'Dockerfile' located where this file is stored
    - This will containerize the image and push it to the the Azure container registry
    - It does take about 10 - 15 minutes for the container to start and run again.
    - Test that it works.  If it does not work, something has gone wrong.  You can get the previous container
      from the Azure container registry.

3.  WaTech updates the SAW security keys
    - So from time to time WaTech updates the keys used to access SAW.  We are supposed to get an email in
      advance but it has not happened yet.
    - You will know this is the issue because a user will get an error when trying to log into the system.
      And the error stack chain will have layers related to SAML authentication.
    - This error is simple to fix. You will get the key from WaTech:
      (Bietz, Aaron (WaTech) <aaron.bietz@watech.wa.gov>)
    - It will look like this in a text file:

      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [Long string of numbers, letters, and other characters]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----

    - Take that string and copy it into the 'sawidp_WaTech_metadata_PROD.xml' file. There are two
      'X509Certificate' nodes in that file. Replace the string in both places with the new certificate key.
    - IMPORTANT - Never publish these files or keys to GitHub!!!

4.  Changing who gets emails
    - There is a setting in the settings.py file that changes who gets admin emails.  Make a change here.
      Then push the change to production.

5. Github
    - The current main branch is 'wsdotprod.'  I would recommend removing all of the other branches.
    - https://github.com/ptddatateam/PublicTransitDataReportingPortal/

6. Passwords:
   -  Keys and passwords used by the application are stored in the 'keys_and_passwords.py' file. Do not publish
      this to github!
